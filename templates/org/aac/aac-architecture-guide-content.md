# H1 title

Other than the H2s listed below, there are no further content requirements for Architecture Guides, except to follow all Microsoft and Learn style and pull request criteria. Diagrams are not required for this content type, but if a diagram is included, it should have a Dataflow/Workflow section underneath the diagram to explain it. See the [Example workload template](sample-solution-templates) sections on Architecture and Dataflow for details.

The Architecture Guide template requires the following sections at the end of the article:
  
## Contributors

> (Expected, but this section is optional if all the contributors would prefer to not include it)

> Start with the explanation text (same for every article), in italics. This makes it clear that Microsoft takes responsibility for the article (not the one contributor). Then include the "Pricipal authors" list and the "Additional contributors" list (if there are additional contributors) (all in plain text, not italics or bold). Link each contributor's name to the person's LinkedIn profile. After the name, place a pipe symbol ("|") with spaces, and then enter the person's title. We don't include the person's company, MVP status, or links to additional profiles (to minimize edits/updates). (The profiles can be linked to from the person's LinkedIn page, and we hope to automate that on the platform in the future). 
> Implement this format:

*This article is maintained by Microsoft. It was originally written by the following contributors.*

Principal authors: > Only the primary authors. List them alphabetically, by last name. Use this format: Fname Lname. If the article gets rewritten, keep the original authors and add in the new one(s).

 * [Author 1 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect"
 * [Author 2 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect"
 * > Continue for each primary author (even if there are 10 of them).

Other contributors: > Include contributing (but not primary) authors, major editors (not minor edits), and technical reviewers. List them alphabetically, by last name. Use this format: Fname Lname. It's okay to add in newer contributors.

 * [Contributor 1 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect"
 * [Contributor 2 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect"

## Next steps

- Bulleted list of third-party and other Learn and Microsoft links.
- Links shouldn't include en-us locale unless they don't work without it.
- Learn links should be site-relative, for example (/azure/feature/article-name).
- Don't include trailing slash in any links.

## Related resources

- Links to related Azure Architecture Center articles.
- Links should be repo-relative, for example (../../solution-ideas/articles/article-name.yml).
