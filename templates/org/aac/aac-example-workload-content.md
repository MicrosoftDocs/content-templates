<!-- Use the aac-browse-header.yml   -->

> Introductory section - no heading
>   In this section, include 1-2 sentences to briefly explain this architecture. 
>   The full scenario info will go in the "Scenario details" section, which is below the "Architecture" H2 (top level) heading, below the "Alternatives" H3 header, and above the "Considerations" H2 (top level) header. That includes the "Potential use cases" H3 section, which goes under the "Scenario details" H2 section. The reason why we moved this content down lower, is because customers want the emphasis on the diagram and architecture first, not the scenario.

## Architecture

> Architecture diagram goes here. Use the following format:

![Diagram of the <solution name> architecture.](./images/<file-name>.png)

> Under the architecture diagram, include this sentence and a link to the Visio file or the PowerPoint file: 

*Download a [Visio file](https://arch-center.azureedge.net/[file-name].vsdx) of this architecture.*

> Note that Visio or PowerPoint files are not allowed in the GitHub repo. Send the file or provide a link so the file can be uploaded to our limited-access CDN server.

### Dataflow

> An alternate title for this sub-section is "Workflow" (if data isn't really involved).
> In this section, include a numbered list that annotates/describes the dataflow or workflow through the solution. Explain what each step does. Start from the user or external data source, and then follow the flow through the rest of the solution (as shown in the diagram).

The following workflow (or dataflow) corresponds to the above diagram:
1. Admin 1 adds, updates, or deletes an entry in Admin 1's fork of the Microsoft 365 config file.
2. Admin 1 commits and syncs the changes to Admin 1's forked repository.
3. Admin 1 creates a pull request (PR) to merge the changes to the main repository.
4. The build pipeline runs on the PR.

### Components

> A bullet list of components in the architecture (including all relevant Azure services) with links to the product service pages. This is for lead generation (what business, marketing, and PG want). It helps drive revenue.

> Why is each component there?
> What does it do and why was it necessary?
> Link the name of the service (via embedded link) to the service's product service page. Be sure to exclude the localization part of the URL (such as "en-US/").

## Considerations

> REQUIRED STATEMENT: Include the following statement to introduce this section:

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that can be used to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework](/azure/architecture/framework).

> Are there any lessons learned from running this that would be helpful for new customers?  What went wrong when building it out?  What went right?
> How do I need to think about managing, maintaining, and monitoring this long term?

> REQUIREMENTS: 
>   You must include the "Cost optimization" section. 
>   You must include at least two of the other H3 sub-sections/pillars: Reliability, Security, Operational excellence, and Performance efficiency.

### Reliability

> REQUIRED STATEMENT: If using this section, include the following statement to introduce the section:

Reliability ensures your application can meet the commitments you make to your customers. For more information, see [Overview of the reliability pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/resiliency/overview).

> This section includes resiliency and availability considerations. They can also be H4 headers in this section, if you think they should be separated.
> Are there any key resiliency and reliability considerations (past the typical)?

### Security

> REQUIRED STATEMENT: If using this section, include the following statement to introduce the section:

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the abuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Overview of the security pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/security/overview).

> This section includes identity and data sovereignty considerations.
> Are there any security considerations (past the typical) that I should know about this?
> Because security is important to our business, be sure to include your Azure security baseline assessment recommendations in this section. See https://aka.ms/AzureSecurityBaselines

### Cost optimization

> REQUIRED: This section is required. Cost is of the utmost importance to our customers.

> REQUIRED STATEMENT: Include the following statement to introduce the section:

Cost optimization is about looking at ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Overview of the cost optimization pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/cost/overview).

> How much will this cost to run? See if you can answer this without dollar amounts.
> Are there ways I could save cost?
> If it scales linearly, than we should break it down by cost/unit. If it does not, why?
> What are the components that make up the cost?
> How does scale affect the cost?

> Link to the pricing calculator (https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator) with all of the components in the architecture included, even if they're a $0 or $1 usage.
> If it makes sense, include small/medium/large configurations. Describe what needs to be changed as you move to larger sizes.

### Operational excellence

> REQUIRED STATEMENT: If using this section, include the following statement to introduce the section:

Operational excellence covers the operations processes that deploy an application and keep it running in production. For more information, see [Overview of the operational excellence pillar](/azure/architecture/framework/devops/overview).

> This includes DevOps, monitoring, and diagnostics considerations.
> How do I need to think about operating this solution?

### Performance efficiency

> REQUIRED STATEMENT: If using this section, include the following statement to introduce the section:

Performance efficiency is the ability of your workload to scale to meet the demands placed on it by users in an efficient manner. For more information, see [Performance efficiency pillar overview](/azure/architecture/framework/scalability/overview).

> This includes scalability considerations.
> Are there any key performance considerations (past the typical)?
> Are there any size considerations around this specific solution? What scale does this work at? At what point do things break or not make sense for this architecture?

## Deploy this scenario

> (Optional, but greatly encouraged)

> Is there an example deployment that can show me this in action?  What would I need to change to run this in production?

## Contributors

> (Expected, but this section is optional if all the contributors would prefer to not be mentioned.)

> Start with the explanation text (same for every section), in italics. This makes it clear that Microsoft takes responsibility for the article (not the one contributor). Then include the "Principal authors" list and the "Other contributors" list, if there are additional contributors (all in plain text, not italics or bold). Link each contributor's name to the person's LinkedIn profile. After the name, place a pipe symbol ("|") with spaces, and then enter the person's title. We don't include the person's company, MVP status, or links to additional profiles (to minimize edits/updates). Implement this format:

*This article is maintained by Microsoft. It was originally written by the following contributors.* 

Principal authors: > Only the primary authors. Listed alphabetically by last name. Use this format: Fname Lname. If the article gets rewritten, keep the original authors and add in the new one(s).

 - [Author 1 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect"
 - [Author 2 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect"
 - > Continue for each primary author (even if there are 10 of them).

Other contributors: > Include contributing (but not primary) authors, major editors (not minor edits), and technical reviewers. Listed alphabetically by last name. Use this format: Fname Lname. It's okay to add in newer contributors.

 - [Contributor 1 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect"
 - [Contributor 2 Name](http://linkedin.com/ProfileURL) | Title, such as "Cloud Solution Architect"
 - > Continue for each additional contributor (even if there are 10 of them).
 
*To see non-public LinkedIn profiles, sign in to LinkedIn.*

## Next steps

> Link to Learn articles, along with any third-party documentation.
> Where should I go next if I want to start building this?
> Are there any relevant case studies or customers doing something similar?
> Is there any other documentation that might be useful? Are there product documents that go into more detail on specific technologies that are not already linked?
