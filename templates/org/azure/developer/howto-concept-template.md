<!-- 1. H1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required. The H1 can use the same text as the title, but it can be longer than 65 characters. Choose an H1 that clearly conveys the action and the language SDK covered in the article.

For example: "Upload a block blob with .NET" or "Download a blob with Python".

-->

# [Action or task] with [SDK language]
TODO: Add your heading

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: Lead with an intro that describes what the article covers. Keep it focused and short.

Readers should have a clear idea of the actions and scenarios covered in this article after reading the introduction.

* Introduction immediately follows the H1 text.
* Introduction section should be 1 paragraph.
* Don't use a bulleted list of article H2 sections.
* Identify the action or task covered in the article, along with the client library and language.

Example: This article shows how to upload a blob using the Azure Storage client library for Python. You can upload data to a block blob from a file path, a stream, a binary object, or a text string. You can also upload blobs with index tags.

-->

TODO: Add your introductory paragraph

<!-- 3. Prerequisites --------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Make Prerequisites the first H2 after the H1. 

* Provide a bulleted list of items that the user needs.
* Omit any preliminary text to the list.
* Address project setup requirements, including packages to install and import or using statements to add to the code.
* Address authorization permissions needed to perform the operation, for example, Azure RBAC roles or SAS permissions.
* Optionally, you can add resource requirements needed to run the code example. It can helpful to include guidance on creating resources needed for the code example. This could be an azd template or a link to a quickstart.

-->

## Prerequisites

TODO: List the prerequisites

<!-- 4. About the operation ---------------------------------------------------------

<!--
Optional. If the operation is sufficiently complex, provide additional information that helps a developer understand important concepts or terminology that are necessary to understand the code examples.
-->

## About [action or task]

TODO: Add conceptual information that helps a developer understand the code samples.

<!-- 5. Identify client library methods for the action or task---------------------------------------------------------

Required. This section identifies the client library method(s) that can be used to perform the operation. Typically this section includes the method name with a link to the SDK reference documentation, and a brief description of the method. In some scenarios, it can be helpful to describe method parameters and return values.

* The H2 should describe the high-level action or task. For example, "Delete a blob" or "Download a blob to a file path".
* Don't number the H2s.
* Include the method name with a link to the SDK reference documentation.
* Avoid listing all method overloads, if several exist.

-->

TODO: Add section to identify client library methods

<!-- 6. Scenario H2s ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Multiple scenarios should be organized in H2 level sections. A section covers a single scenario identified in the article introduction. Each section is represented as an H2 in the article.

* Each H2 should be a major scenario that uses the operation described in the article. For example, "Upload a block blob from a stream" or "Download a blob to a file path".
* Don't number the H2s.
* Begin each H2 with a brief explanation of the scenario for context.
* If the scenario uses a different method than the ones identified in the earlier section, you can include the method name with a link to the SDK reference documentation.
* Each scenario should include a code example that demonstrates how to perform the operation using the client library.
* The code example should be narrowly focused on the operation, and should avoid including superfluous code.
* It can be helpful to include package versions that were used when last testing the code example. This can be included in a comment at the top of the code example, and helps the user understand why the code example may not work if they are using a different version of the package.

-->

## [Scenario 1...n]

TODO: Add introductory sentences to describe the scenario.
[For complex scenarios that require additional information, you can add an explanatory paragraph to cover the details.]

TODO: Add code example to demonstrate the scenario.

<!-- 7. Resources ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Optional. You can add additional resources to guide the user to related content. This section can include links to other articles, videos, or other content that is relevant to the scenario. This section can also include links to REST API reference documentation for the operation.

* REST API resources: For some services, it may be helpful to include links to the REST API reference documentation for the operation. This can help developers understand the underlying REST API operation that is invoked by the client library method.
* Code samples: If there are full code samples where the article snippets come from, you can link to them here.
* Client library resources: You can link to reference documentation, source code, or package downloads.
* Related articles: You can link to other articles that are related to the action or task.
