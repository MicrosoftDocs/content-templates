<!--

There are three types of Task group/action file:

* Single variable of task
* Single task (only 1 variation)
* Group of tasks

Required. The H1 can use the same text as the title, but it can be longer than 65 characters.

The H1 depends on which type of task group/action file you are creating. 

* Single variable of task
    * Example: Copy a blob from a source
* Single task (only 1 variation)
    * Example: Create a container
* Group of tasks
    * Example: Encrypt and decrypt a key

-->

TODO: Add your heading

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required. Lead with an intro that describes the tasks. Keep it focused.

* Introduction immediately follows the H1 text.
* Introduction section should be 1 paragraph.
* Don't use a bulleted list of article H2 sections.

Example: 


Blobs in Azure Storage are organized into containers. Before you can upload a blob, you must first create a container. This article shows how to create containers with the Azure Storage client library for JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

<!--

Required. List the prerequisites for the task. 

Example: 

The examples in this article assume you already have a project set up to work with the Azure Blob Storage client library for JavaScript. To learn about setting up your project, including package installation, importing modules, and creating an authorized client object to work with data resources, see Get started with Azure Blob Storage and JavaScript.
The authorization mechanism must have permissions to create a blob container.

## Task specific guidance

<!--

Optional.

Depending on your service and the SDK, you may need to include information unique to a task group action file that a developer needs to be successful. Depending on the complexity of the information, it can be in a single H2 or multiple H2s.

Examples include: 

* Naming conventions
* SKU/pricing tier functionality

-->

TODO: Add your task specific guidance

## <action> a <object>

<!--

Required. Repeat this section for each action in the task group.

The H2 should describe the task and how it works. This doesn't have to be a long section, but it should provide a brief overview of the task and how it works. The code snippet should be as usable as possible for the user. They should be able to copy and paste into their own application with minimal changes.

Each section should include the following in a scannable format:

* Client object/method reference documentation link
* Response object reference documentation link
* The code snippet should have minimal comments because this isn't localized. If comments for the code are necessary, they should be in the markdown after the code snippet.
