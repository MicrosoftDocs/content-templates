This template provides the basic structure of a Overview article pattern. See the [instructions - Overview](../level4/article-overview.md) in the pattern library.

You can provide feedback about this template at: https://aka.ms/patterns-feedback

Overview is an article pattern that covers two aspects of a product or service:

* What is it?
* What is it used for?

An Overview article talks about the product or service from a technical point of view. It's not intended to define the benefits or value proposition. That just duplicates marketing.

<!-- 1. H1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: This is the primary heading at the top of the article.

Use the format "What is <service>?" 

You can also use this in the TOC if your service name doesn’t cause the phrase to wrap.

-->

# What is <product/service>? 
TODO: Add your heading

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: Lead with a light intro that describes what the article covers. Answer the fundamental “why would I want to know this?” question. Keep it short.

Many services add artwork or videos below the Introduction.

-->

[Introductory paragraph]
TODO: Add your introductory paragraph

<!---Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over them. Better to put that info
directly into the article text.

--->

<!-- 3. H2s (Article body)------------------------------------------------------------ 

Required: The article body should discuss the features that answer the "Why should I care?" question with a bit more depth.

Give each H2 a heading that sets expectations for the content that follows. 
Follow the H2 headings with a sentence about how the section contributes to the whole.
Add images, code blocks, or other graphical elements after the information it illustrates.

* Call out any basic requirements and dependencies.
* Call out limitations or overhead.
* Don't catalog every feature. Some might only need to be mentioned as available, without any discussion.
* Give each H2 a heading that sets expectations for the content that follows.
* Follow the H2 headings with a sentence about how the section contributes to the whole.
* Images, code blocks, or other graphical elements come after the text block it illustrates.
Don't number H2s.

## [Section 1 heading]
TODO: add your content

## [Section 2 heading]
TODO: add your content

## [Section n heading]
TODO: add your content

<!-- 4. Related content ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

Optional: For manually curated links in this pattern.

  - For Related content provide 1-3 links. Include some context so the customer can determine why they would click the link. Add a context sentence for the following links.

-->

## Related content

TODO: Add your next step link(s)
