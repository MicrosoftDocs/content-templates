This template provides the basic structure of a Glossary article pattern. See the 
[instructions - Glossary](../level4/article-glossary.md) in the pattern library.

You can provide feedback about this template at: https://aka.ms/patterns-feedback

-->

<!-- 1. H1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required:  Use `Glossary: <product>` as the H1 and article title. 
Example: Glossary: IoT, or Glossary: Security

-->

# Glossary: <product>
TODO: Add your heading

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: 
Begin the glossary with an introduction and include keywords that make it easier to find 
the article in search (ex. product name, common industry terms). 
Example: This article lists some of the common terms used to talk about Azure IoT. It 
includes definitions and guidelines such as capitalization. 

Note: Including guidelines is optional although some feedback from social media suggests 
users like these details.

-->

TODO: Add your introductory paragraph

<!-- 3. Section H2s ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Make the H2s letters in alphabetical order and use H3s for the terms. Skip letters if the 
glossary lacks terms that start with that letter. Combine headers into a range so that you have at 
least three items for each header. For example, ## A-D.

Keep the definitions short and format consistently to optimize readability. There are three 
elements:

  * What the term is.
  * What the term does.
  * Example if helpful.
  
  You can optionally add a link to further information.

* Provide usage guidance -- this is optional :

  * Capitalization.
  * First use vs. subsequent uses.
  * Approved and unapproved acronyms and abbreviations.

Example definition:
