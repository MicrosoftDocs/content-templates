Known issues articles help inform customers of issues that they may encounter that are currently
being worked on or planned to be fixed in the near future. Known issues added to the article should
be removed when the issue has been resolved. If the issue is never going to be resolved, it should
be documented in a conceptual or how-to article as expected behavior.
