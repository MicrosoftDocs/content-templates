1. H1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: For the H1 - that's the primary heading at the top of the article - use the format "What
is <service>?" You can also use this in the TOC if your service name doesnâ€™t cause the phrase to
wrap.

-->

# [H1 heading]
TODO: Add your heading

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: Start this article with an introductory paragraph. The goal is to help customers quickly
determine whether the article is relevant.

Here are the details:

- Begin with a 1-2 sentence summary of the category and the use cases to which the services apply.
- Include a bulleted list with this lead-in sentence: "This article compares the following services:".
- In each bulleted item, include a link to the overview article for the service. (TODO: FOR DISCUSSION)
- Place this section immediately after the article headline (H1).

<!-- 3. Choose a candidate service ------------------------------------------------------------

the first H2 in the article; that is, place it immediately after the introduction. Begin with the
text "This section helps you select the most likely services for your needs." Include a concise
decision guide as a flowchart, table, and/or text as appropriate. End the section with the text "The
result of this section is a starting point for consideration. Use the following sections to perform
a detailed evaluation of the service to confirm that it meets your needs."
