This template provides the basic structure of a Checklist article pattern. See the
[instructions - Checklist](../level4/article-checklist.md) in the pattern library.

You can provide feedback about this template at: https://aka.ms/patterns-feedback
A Checklist is a documentation article pattern that presents a list of requirements
or tasks to complete.

The items in a checklist are a cohesive group, and not simply a bulleted list in an
article.
The items in a checklist help the customer successfully complete a task (or series of 
tasks), or use a product or feature.

-->

<!-- 1. H1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Pick an H1 that clearly conveys the what the checklist conveys.

Use the word "checklist".

Identify the technology or service involved (e.g. App Service, Cosmos DB, etc.) and
the language or framework, if applicable (.NET Core, Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.); 
the language or framework shouldn't appear in parentheses.

-->

# <X> checklist <or> <X> checklist for <technology or product>
TODO: Add your H1.

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraphs ---------------------------------------------------------

Required: Provide a brief introduction that describes the task that
this checklist supports.

Emphasize general industry terms (such as "serverless," which are better for SEO) more
than Microsoft-branded terms or acronyms (such as "Azure Functions" or "ACR").
Try to include terms people typically search for and avoid using *only* Microsoft terms.

If the checklist describes prerequisites, explain what task they are for, but avoid
linking to the task here.
The reader shouldn't leave the checklist until completed.

If the checklist supports a periodic task, give a brief idea of how often the task
should be done.

-->

[Add your introductory paragraphs]
TODO: Add your introductory paragraphs

This checklist provides a convenient way to access information you may need to support [X] when using [Microsoft product].

<!--
- Avoid any indication of the time it takes to complete the checklist, because there's
  already the "x minutes to read" at the top and making a second suggestion can be 
  contradictory. (The standard line is probably misleading, but that's a matter for
  site design.)

- If your article includes several sections of checklists, consider an overview list
  that links to the sections in the article. Use this approach sparingly, because it
  encourages the reader to look at items out of order.

-->

<!-- 3. Checklist sections --------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Organize your items into one or more lists. 
Each item can be a task to complete or a requirement that must be met.

Use a single H2 with a list or table or create more than one H2 each with a list
or table.
If you use more than one list, divide the items into groups that make sense.

-->

## <Checklist>
TODO: Add one or more lists.

<!-- 4. Link to additional information.

Optional: Present a section with more information about the tasks or prerequisites in
the list.

-->
## More information
TODO: Add optional section with more details.

<!-- 5. Next steps ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Your checklist should always have a Next steps H2 that points to the next task
after completing the checklist.
The next task might be an installation task that requires the checklist.

For a single link, you can use the Next steps button. 

For multiple next steps, use a short list with links and maybe a brief explanation.

-->
