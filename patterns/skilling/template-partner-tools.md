This template provides the basic structure of a Partner tools article pattern. See the
[instructions -  Partner tools](../level4/global-partner-tools-template.md) in the pattern library.

You can provide feedback about this template at: https://aka.ms/patterns-feedback

Partners build tools and solutions that extend and scale Microsoft owned applications.
These partners may resell their solutions through Azure Marketplace or their sites. 

A partner tools article lists the tools and solutions for Microsoft applications.
Include links to their products for download and documentation.

There are two approaches for partner tools article:

* One or more H2 sections with a table that summarizes partner tools.
* One H2 section for each partner tool.

New partners are added over time and existing partners may no longer support your
solution. Plan to keep this article current over time.

-->

<!-- 1. H1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Include the word "partners" and the Microsoft product or service.

If relevant, include the area that the partner tools address. For instance:

* Azure Storage data governance, management, and migration partners
  Area: data governance, management, and migration
* Azure Storage partners for primary and secondary storage
  Area: primary and secondary storage

-->

# <product> <feature area> partners [or] <product> partners <feature area>
TODO: Add your heading.

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: Briefly introduce Microsoft product or service and how the partner tools
supplement it. Be clear that Microsoft does not support third-party products.

-->

[Add your introductory paragraph]
TODO: Add your introductory paragraph, such as the following examples:

This article highlights Microsoft partner companies that . . .

<or>

To manage [technology or task], choose from a wide variety of industry-leading tools . . .

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft does not provide support for third-party products.

<!-- 3a H2 sections with partner tools table --------------------------------------------

Required: Either this approach or the approach described in 3b, but not both.

One or more sections that list the partner tools. If the tools address
different workflows or aspects of the technology, use multiple sections. For instance:

* Identity verification and proofing
* MFA and Passwordless authentication
* Role-based access control
* Secure hybrid access to on-premises application

For articles with only one partners H2, try to name this section something more helpful
that "Partners". For instance:

* Data governance, management, and migration partners
* Primary and secondary storage

These section usually contains a table, with or without introductory text. For instance:

| Partner | Description | Links |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- |
| <Partner logo or name as link> | Description of the partner solution | Link to website, or other resources, like Twitter or a video |

If you use the partner logo, be sure to include the partner name as text in
the Description.

If relevant, include a column for region:

| Partner	| Capabilities & experience	| Supported countries/regions |
| ------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------- | 

-->

## Partners for <task or technology>

| Partner | Description | Links |
| ------- | ----------- | ----- |

TODO: Create section and populate your table.

<!-- 3b H2 sections for each partner tool -----------------------------------------------

Required: Either this approach or the approach described in 3a, but not both.

Devote an H2 section to each partner tool.

If possible, include the same information described in section 3a in this template:

* Partner logo
* Partner name
* Description
* Links
* Region, if applicable

-->

## <name of partner>
TODO: Add partners sections.

<!-- 4. Next steps ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Required. Add one to three links to useful resources for the customer. Unless the link
text itself is clear, add a sentence explaining why the resources might be useful.

 --->

## Next steps
TODO: Add links.
