This template provides the basic structure of a Overview article pattern. See the
[instructions - Overview](../level4/article-overview.md) in the pattern library.

You can provide feedback about this template at: https://aka.ms/patterns-feedback

 1. H1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: For the H1 - that's the primary heading at the top of the article - use the format "What
is <service>?" You can also use this in the TOC if your service name doesnâ€™t cause the phrase to
wrap.

-->

# What is <product/service>? 
TODO: Add your heading

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraph ----------------------------------------------------------

Required: The introductory paragraph helps customers quickly determine whether an article is
relevant. Describe in customer-friendly terms what the service is and does, and why the customer
should care. Keep it short for the intro. You can go into more detail later in the article. Many
services add artwork or videos below the introduction.

-->

[Introductory paragraph]
TODO: Add your introductory paragraph

<!---Avoid notes, tips, and important boxes. Readers tend to skip over them. Better to put that info
directly into the article text.

--->

<!-- 3. Article body ------------------------------------------------------------ Required: After
the intro, you can develop your overview by discussing the features that answer the "Why should I
care" question with a bit more depth. Be sure to call out any basic requirements and dependencies,
as well as limitations or overhead. Don't catalog every feature, and some may only need to be
mentioned as available, without any discussion.

-->

[Article body]
TODO: Add your article body

<!-- Top tasks ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Suggested: An effective way to structure you overview article is to create an H2 for the top
customer tasks you identified during the [planning process](../contribute/content-dev-plan.md) and
describe how the product/service helps customers with that task.

Create a new H2 for each task you list.

--->

## \<Top task\>

<!-- 5. Next steps ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: In Overview articles, provide at least one next step and no more than three. Next steps in
overview articles will often link to a quickstart. Use regular links; do not use a blue box link.
What you link to will depend on what is really a next step for the customer. Do not use a "More info
section" or a "Resources section" or a "See also section".

TODO: Add your next step link(s)
