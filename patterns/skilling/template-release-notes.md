This template provides the basic structure of a Release notes article pattern. See the
[instructions - Release notes](../level4/article-release-notes.md) in the pattern library.

You can provide feedback about this template at: https://aka.ms/patterns-feedback

A release notes article highlights capabilities, features, and enhancements recently
released or improved. Or, the emphasis can be on identifying critical open and
resolved issues. 

A common format is to add a new H2 section at the beginning of the article with each
release, pushing the older release notes down.

Another format is to have a series of H2 sections for different aspects of a major
release. This type of article isn't added to during a release cadence. 
Consider using a [What's new in <product> pattern](whats-new-product.md) instead.

-->

<!-- 1. H1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Include "release notes". For instance: "Release notes for [product]"

-->

# Release notes for [product]
TODO: Add your heading.

<!-- 2. Introduction --------------------------------------------------------------------

Required.

A simple sentence stating that this article is release notes for a product is acceptable.

Release notes introductions can also contain information about release frequency, links
to product versions, and feature highlights.

-->

[Your introduction]
TODO: Add your introduction.

<!-- 3. General product information -----------------------------------------------------

Optional. H2 section, such as _Supported platforms_, _Tools_, or _Supported versions_.
These sections describe general information. Try to minimize, since general information
should be part of the product documentation.

Some release notes articles use a _Known issues_ section near the end. If you include
known issues, be sure that they are current. Remove issues that have been addressed.

-->

## [General H2 sections (Optional)]
TODO: Add general sections, if used.

<!-- 4. Most recent release -------------------------------------------------------------

Required. H2 which identifies the release by version number or by date.

List changes for this release. Use a list or tables. Add extra explanation as text or
notes, as needed.

You can also break this section into different lists, such as _Improvements_, 
_Bug fixes_, or _Known issues_.

When a new release becomes available, add new release notes as a new section at the top
of the article in this format.

-->

## [Release version number or date]
TODO: Add your most recent release notes.

<!-- 5. Previous releases or Release history --------------------------------------------

Optional. Add an H2 section. 

Consider adding a summary list or table of the previous releases. These are
the sections that were previously the "Most recent release" in the previous section.

Link to the older sections, which are now later in the article.

Every time you add new release notes, move the most recent release notes down and add
an entry and link to the summary.

--->


## Previous releases [or Release history]
TODO: Add table for previous release.

<!-- 6. Previous release sections H2s or H3s --------------------------------------------

Required, if you have release notes for previous versions.

Use the same format as the previous "Most recent release" section. Keep the header
title format consistent, using the version number or date of the release.

If you're using a "Previous releases" section, you have the option of making these
sections either H2 or H3. If you leave them as H2, they continue to appear under 
"In this article" in the upper right. 

--->

## [Release version number or date for next most current version]
TODO: Add previous release notes for versions, most recent first.

<!-- 7. Next steps ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Optional. Include links that might be useful or interesting to the customer.

Customers sometimes review release notes before installing a product. Overviews and
quickstarts can be helpful. Don't add links specific to a particular release, even the
most current.

--->

## Next steps
TODO: Add links.
