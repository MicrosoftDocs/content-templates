This template provides the basic structure of a Limits and quotas article pattern. See the
[instructions - Limits and quotas](../level4/article-limits-and-quotas.md) in the pattern library.

You can provide feedback about this template at: https://aka.ms/patterns-feedback

A _limits and quotas_ article lists the extent or thresholds to which
resources and settings can be allocated and sized within the scope
of an account or subscription. 

Quotas are sometimes modifiable, and instructions for how to adjust or request 
changes are sometimes included in the article if applicable.

-->

<!-- 1. H1 --------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: Preferred wording: "<product or service> limits and quotas".

The headline (H1) is the primary heading at the top of the article.
Pick an H1 that clearly conveys what the content's about.

-->

# [product or service] limits and quotas
TODO: Add your heading.

<!-- 2. Introduction ----------------------------------------------------------

Give a brief introduction to the article.

If your article includes several sections with different limits and quotas,
consider explaining the types, unless that information is obvious from the
section headers.

Include any notes that apply to all limits and quotas for the product or
service.

-->

The following tables provide quotas and limits for [product or service].
TODO: Add your introduction.

<!-- 3. Explanatory H2 sections -----------------------------------------------

Optional: Include explanations necessary for limits and quotas, such as
Managing limits.

Use this section for general information too substantial to put in the
introduction. For information about specific limits and quotas, include in
the relevant H2 instead. 

-->

## [Global information for limits and quotas for product or service (Optional)]

<!-- 4. Limits and quotas table H2 sections -----------------------------------

Required one or more H2 sections, each with a short introduction, a table
summarizing limits and quotas, and any relevant notes.

Divide your limits and quotas as appropriate. For instance, "Common limits" in
one section, limits for different tier types in another. Or "Account limits", 
"Asset limits", "Storage limits", and others.

Include short explanations in the table with the limit or in a separate notes
column. 

Include information common to all the resources in the table as notes or text
in the section introduction.

-->

## [H2 section]
TODO: Add one or more H2 sections with tables.

<!-- 4. Next steps ------------------------------------------------------------

Include one to three links to articles the customer might find useful.
Use a list or introduce the links in a brief paragraph.

Unless the article titles offer the customer enough information about
why a resource would be useful for them, include some text, such as
"For more information about usage amounts . . ." or "After you set quotas and
limits that apply to [product or service], the suggested next step is 
[product or service] architecture."

-->

## Next steps
TODO: Add links to useful resources.
