This template provides the basic structure of a Best practices article pattern. See the
[instructions - Best practices](../level4/article-best-practices.md) in the pattern library.

You can provide feedback about this template at: https://aka.ms/patterns-feedback

Best practices are recommendations for working with a service or feature. Best practices articles
should contain stable practices for most situations. If you have recommendations for special cases
or stop-gap fixes until an expected release, consider a blog post instead.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<!-- 1. H1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Required. Write an H1 that clearly conveys what the best practices are for.

Use the words "best practices". Identify the product or service and the feature area that the best
practices cover. The H1 can use the same text as the title, but it can be longer than 65 characters.

-->

# Best practices for [service or product]

TODO: Add your H1.

<!-- 2. Introductory paragraphs ---------------------------------------------------------

Required. Provide a brief introduction that describes area that the article covers and the issues
that the best practices address.

Set context for readers on what "best practices" means. Be clear that these recommendations aren't
required and might not be appropriate for every configuration. Explain potential benefits of
following the best practices and any potential tradeoffs.

-->

[Add your introductory paragraphs]
TODO: Add your introductory paragraphs

<!-- 3. Best practices sections ---------------------------------------------------------

Required. Describe best practices in one or more H2 sections. Use H3 sections to organize best
practices within the H2 sections.

Organize best practices as you would other material. If some apply to the whole service, put them in
a single section. Put practices that apply to a feature or topical area of the service in their own
sections.

If the following conditions are met, consider creating multiple best practices articles grouped with
similar articles in the TOC:

- Your best practices span several feature areas or parts of the service.
- There are more than one or two best practices for each feature area.
- Your TOC lends itself to grouping by feature or topical area of the service.

If the following conditions are met, consider creating multiple best practices articles grouped
together in a Best Practices category in the TOC:

- Your best practices span several feature areas or parts of the service.
- There are more than one or two best practices for each feature area.
- Your TOC isn't topically grouped.

## [best practices section]

TODO: Add one or more best practices sections.

<!-- 4. Next steps ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Optional.
Include a Next steps H2 section that points to the other useful articles. If your article is part of
a group of best practices articles, link to those articles.

Although not all best practices articles use Next steps, the section is strongly recommended because
the links provide the reader with a clear path forward.
