We write general troubleshooting articles when a specific error message isn't known.

<!-- 1. H1 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Required: The headline (H1) is the primary heading at the top of the article. Pick an H1 that
clearly conveys what the content's about.

The heading of the general troubleshooting article should concisely describe the issue that the
customer is trying to fix. Make sure to include the word **troubleshoot** somewhere in the H1 of the
article to improve SEO.

content to assist them before they begin.
